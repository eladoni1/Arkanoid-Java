# Arkanoid-Java

### No engine, Arkanoid (Block Breaker) game, built in Java (IntelliJ IDE).

##### This is only a mockup of my 2nd year project, not the original code (which had much more content.. levels, highest score, ability to choose level by number at command line)

In order to play the levels you desire you would have to go to the Main class under the ```src``` folder, and edit the list parameter in the function 
```g.setLevels(new LevelInformation[] { <*insert levels here...*> })```.



Once done, run the program, and the game will start.

You will have a countdown before the balls and paddle can move, so you could have a better understanding of the level.
* If you win - you will be automatically moved to the next level.
* If you lose - the game will stop completely.

Further development on the project would include the implementation of Highest Score list, ability to play with 2 players, and creation of new levels and special blocks in order to make the game more captivating and challenging than it currently is.
